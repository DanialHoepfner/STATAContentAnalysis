This repository has a sample dataset and a STATA .do file for doing an analysis of topics and contries considered for conference papers.
It shows an example of classifying papers by the language they were written in, gets a list of most used words, tests topic areas by country, and whether some topics more often go together.
Code was written in STATA 14, but should work in any version that supports unicode.
The dataset ConferenceExample13 is for users without STATA14, dataset could not be saved in any older format, due to large strings.
Replace and use commands with the 13 suffix to run if using STATA 13
